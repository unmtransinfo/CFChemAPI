## Python Environment Setup

1. Make sure you are in the `/app` folder: `cd app/`
2. Setup and activate the project's virtual environment. For example, with conda use:
   ```
   conda create -n cfchem-api python=3.14 && conda activate cfchem-api
   ```
3. Install pip-tools: `pip install pip-tools`
4. Sync the environment: `pip-sync`
